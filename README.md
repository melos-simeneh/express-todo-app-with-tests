# Express Todo App with Tests

A simple Express-based Todo application featuring **unit**, **integration**, and **load testing**. This project uses **Jest** and **Supertest** for testing, and **Artillery** for load testing. It provides an API to manage todos, with functionality to create, read, update, and delete todos.

## Features

- **Create Todo**
- **Get All Todos**
- **Get Todo by ID**
- **Update Todo**
- **Delete Todo**

## Technologies

This application is built with the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions
- **uuid**: For generating unique IDs
- **Artillery**: Modern, powerful, and easy-to-use load testing toolkit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/melos-simeneh/express-todo-app-with-tests.git
    cd express-todo-app-with-tests
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Express server on **port 3000**.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite and check the code coverage, use the following commands:

### Run Tests Without Coverage

```bash
npm run test
```

This command runs Jest tests and outputs the results to the terminal. It's faster when you only need to verify functionality.

**Sample Output**:
![Test Output](./test_ouput.png)

### Run Tests Coverage

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

This command runs Jest tests and generates a coverage report. It will output the test results and coverage percentage, helping you track the coverage. Your goal is to achieve **100%** code coverage.

**Sample Output**:
![Coverage Test Output](./coverage_test_ouput.png)

### Load Testing with Artillery

To simulate traffic and evaluate the performance of your application, Artillery load testing is included.

**Run Load Test**
To run the load tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run load-test
```

This will use **Artillery** to simulate a series of API requests and provide performance metrics for your Express application.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple, yet effective way to test and load test an Express-based Todo application. It utilizes **Jest** and **Supertest** for unit and integration tests, ensuring that all endpoints work as expected, while also using **Artillery** to evaluate how the application performs under load.
